# Offstack
A Decentralized Application (DAPP) Framework based on the Off System
## Overview
The Offstack consists of a network of networks and design frameworks for building decentralized web applications. The tool consist of :
* The Off System
* The On System
* Water Slide
* Vaccuum Tube
* Smarteez

##Rationale
There is a race on to decentralize all the things. Much of the toolsets, languages and design patterns are alienating to the average web or fullstack developers. Furthermore most of the popular distributed computing tools that operate in peer2peer are mercantile and trustless (ie: Bitcoin, Ethereum, MaidSafe). Because they use tokens to monetize the network resources it uses as incentives for their user, it also incentivizes adversarial behavior both from and economic standpoint and a network security standpoint. This is not a needed or desireable property for many purposes of the applications and websites on the internet. So when trying to create a foundation for a decentralized internet using these tools as a basis for non-competitive or non-commercial uses ties their ability to operate and maintain themselves to the threats and security problems of finanacial networks. Introducing more likely points of failure for infrastructures not purely financial or capitalistic in nature.

Only since Bitcoin has p2p and decentralization become synonymous with tokens. Prior to it was mostly associated with p2p file sharing, content distribution, and distributed computing.
