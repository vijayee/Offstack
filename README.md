# Offstack
A Decentralized Application (DAPP) Framework based on the Off System
## Overview
The Offstack consists of a network of networks and design frameworks for building decentralized web applications. The tool consist of :
* The Off System
* The On System
* Water Slide
* Vaccuum Tube
* Smarteez
## Rationale
There is a race on to decentralize all the things. Much of the toolsets, languages and design patterns are alienating to the average web or fullstack developers. Furthermore most of the popular distributed computing tools that operate in peer2peer are mercantile and trustless (ie: Bitcoin, Ethereum, MaidSafe). Because they use tokens to monetize the resources it incentivizes adversarial behavior both from and economic standpoint and a network security standpoint.
